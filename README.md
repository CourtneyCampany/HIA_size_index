# HIA_size_index
HIA nursery tree size index data set

This repository includes the raw data set for HIA tree stock standards project. A batch means data set is also included for ease of use. As a reminder, there are a few measured batches with container volumes meaningfully smaller than the current standard specifies (<18L). These batches are generally trimmed from the data set for analysis.
